Despite not updating this as frequently I’ve been working pretty steadily. I talked to Bill Huang about simplifying the camshaft mechanism. He thought it would be easier to change the cam lobes to like a true offset cam shaft. I don’t think I’m describing this well, but essentially a pipe with different pipes offset. 

The design would rely on bearings around a pipe. The biggest diameter bearing I can get fairly cheaply off McMaster is 1-1/4 inches. At 1-1/2 inches the cost goes up dramatically. I’ll try to look into other sources though. Bearings Direct has some 1-1/2” ID bearings in stock at under $10 — that’s definitely a better deal than MCM, but I’d have to wait for shipping. <a href="www.google.com>hello?</a>

The EVA film came in yesterday. I’ve yet to experiment with that, hurricanes have slowed down my progress. 

Over the last week I’ve been working on converting all my solid part designing into sheet metal designs. It was a lot more complicated than I anticipated it to be. 

Today I ordered the steel sheet to start fabricating the structure components. I also ordered the motor that will drive the entire unit. 

I’ve been in contact with a welder that is going to weld together the win structure. I’ve finally accepted that joining aluminum is beyond me with this quick of a time frame.

I attended the AE machine shop training today. I’m not overly sure what rights it gives me to the machines there, but I made friends with the instructor so I think that will be a good resource. 

My favorite line from training: “Y’all, it’s just like fishin’…”

I recut or sanded down my aluminum pieces to keep experimenting with different fastening methods. I also made some really good progress redesigning the head piece in Solidworks. This new piece strikes a better balance between my vision for what it should look like and something that’s actually manufacturable.

I’m trying to figure out how to seal these solar panels off from the elements. One solution I found was a melted EVA sheet over the panels. 

“Tabbing wire” is used to connect multiple panels together. 

Another option would be to use a resin or epoxy to seal in the panels. I think that would be difficult to evenly coat the epoxy on the curved wing surface. 

I ordered two different sheets of EVA film off of Amazon, but it won’t be here for the next 1-2 weeks. I may be able to pick some up for testing at a staples (I think it’s a very similar film), but honestly the prototype of the fabric covering and solar setup probably won’t be done until next week.

Tested the aluminum brazing with some aluminum I picked up from McMaster. It worked alright. I need to find a better way to hold the aluminum in place while I braze it. 

## Monday August 28

I did no work past Wednesday. Today I researched what I need to weld stainless steel. The recommendations I’ve read is keeping the C02 content below 5% or O2 content below 3%. Though, these are just recommendations and realistically welding stainless steel is possible with a wide range of equipment, just with varying results. 

I think I should look into having another welder weld the aluminum. I’m concerned the stainless steel will be too difficult to bend and work with. 

I have a couple of options:
Weld stainless steel with less-than-ideal equipment
Weld stainless steel with ideal equipment 
Try to bullshit weld aluminum with less-than-ideal equipment
Braze aluminum with a regular torch

I’m thinking about experimenting with the Bernzomatic AL3 rods off of amazon.

Shopped for solar panels today. While a commercial solution with everything wired up would be easiest, I like the idea of using the bare panels and wiring and sealing everything myself. I think that gives me the best flexibility. I ordered a lot of 10 experimental panels off of eBay for $20, and will do some experimentation with them when they come in next week. 

I’ve also started to look into the fabric coating. I’m looking into a Dacron covering, but I’m concerned about the UV wear. I read about some “Sits A0 100” coating, but I can’t seem to find the stuff anywhere. Realistically it’ll only be outside for two years, and it doesn’t need to be flight worthy so I’m not too concerned. 

I also don’t know how to seal the fabric, but I’m thinking some kind of exterior acrylic latex paint. I’m thinking I’ll want some sort of paint sprayer to apply that. I’m thinking I’ll run to home depot and get the Wagner 350 HVLP — seems cheap but good enough to do what I want. The manual says it can spray “Urethanes, Latex and oil based paints” but some thinning may be required for latex or oil based paints. 

I went to metal supermarket and picked up some regular steel as well as some 304 stainless steel. I was concerned I wouldn’t be able to weld the stainless, but it worked out alright. I think I’ll be using the stainless for the heron, for it’s corrosion resistance, lighter color and weldability. 

I’m planning on returning my argon cylinder to Airgas — I don’t need it anymore. Hopefully they’ll let me exchange it for C25 or Tri-mix. 

I did some more testing with aluminum welding, but beyond not being able to get the wire to feed I also punched through the walls of every test piece. I just can’t weld it without it melting. Seems like more trouble than it’s worth. 

## Tues August 22

I began experimenting with aluminum welding. I had some difficulties hooking up the argon shielding gas to the welder, but used some soapy water to find the gas leaks. 

The aluminum welding wire is so soft and flexible that it just bunches up inside the welder and doesn’t go down the line to the gun. It looks like I’ll need a spool gun, but my welder doesn’t support a spool gun. I might have to move to a steel frame, but I don’t really like the color of steel. A stainless steel might be a little better. Or I could use steel and nickel or zinc coat it. I could use paint, but I really like the look of a bare metal.
